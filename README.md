# PYTHON-PERSONAL-AI-ASSISTANT
This personal voice assistant will be easy to use and will reduce the manual human efforts for performing various tasks. The functionality of the current voice assistant system is limited to working on desktop based and working on line which is required to have internet connection to perform task only. It is simple and effective to use. We have to ask some basic questions and the AI assistant will guide us and give the answers to the respective questions. This project is a collaboration with @aryankhandare
